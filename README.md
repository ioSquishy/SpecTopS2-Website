# SpecTopS2-Website
This website was made to allow the class members that graduated from Woodrow Wilson Highschool in 1973 to reconnect at a reunion party.

Because the website is no longer in use, form submissions are now in a publicly viewable demo google sheet available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdR3daufaLKMp-r1-3ZI_qnjnrd8nFzahnURXACT-EA/edit?usp=sharing
